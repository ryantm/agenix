## Problem and solution

All files in the Nix store are readable by any system user, so it is not a suitable place for including cleartext secrets. Many existing tools (like NixOps deployment.keys) deploy secrets separately from `nixos-rebuild`, making deployment, caching, and auditing more difficult. Out-of-band secret management is also less reproducible.

`agenix` solves these issues by using your pre-existing SSH key infrastructure and `age` to encrypt secrets into the Nix store. Secrets are decrypted using an SSH host private key during NixOS system activation.

## Features

* Secrets are encrypted with SSH keys
  * system public keys via `ssh-keyscan`
  * can use public keys available on GitHub for users (for example, https://github.com/ryantm.keys)
* No GPG
* Very little code, so it should be easy for you to audit
* Encrypted secrets are stored in the Nix store, so a separate distribution mechanism is not necessary

## Notices

* Password-protected ssh keys: since the underlying tool age/rage do not support ssh-agent, password-protected ssh keys do not work well. For example, if you need to rekey 20 secrets you will have to enter your password 20 times.

## Installation

    commit = "298b235f664f925b433614dc33380f0662adfc3f";
  in [
    "${builtins.fetchTarball {
      url = "https://github.com/ryantm/agenix/archive/${commit}.tar.gz";
      # replace this with an actual hash
      sha256 = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
    }}/modules/age.nix"

```

### Install via Flakes

#### Install module via Flakes

```nix
{
  inputs.agenix.url = "github:ryantm/agenix";
  # optional, not necessary for the module
  #inputs.agenix.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, agenix }: {
    # change `yourhostname` to your actual hostname
    nixosConfigurations.yourhostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      # change to your system:
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        agenix.nixosModule
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

#### Install CLI via Flakes

You don't need to install it,

```ShellSession
nix run github:ryantm/agenix -- --help
```

but, if you want to (change the system based on your system):

```nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = [ agenix.defaultPackage.x86_64-linux ];
}
```

## Tutorial

1. The system you want to deploy secrets to should already exist and
   have `sshd` running on it so that it has generated SSH host keys in
   `/etc/ssh/`.

2. Make a directory to store secrets and `secrets.nix` file for listing secrets and their public keys (This file is **not** imported into your NixOS configuration. It is only used for the `agenix` CLI.):

   ```ShellSession
   $ mkdir secrets
   $ cd secrets
   $ touch secrets.nix
   ```
3. Add public keys to `secrets.nix` file (hint: use `ssh-keyscan` or GitHub (for example, https://github.com/ryantm.keys)):
   ```nix
   let
     user1 = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIL0idNvgGiucWgup/mP78zyC23uFjYq0evcWdjGQUaBH";
     user2 = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAILI6jSq53F/3hEmSs+oq9L4TwOo1PrDMAgcA1uo1CCV/";
     users = [ user1 user2 ];

     system1 = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIPJDyIr/FSz1cJdcoW69R+NrWzwGK/+3gJpqD1t8L2zE";
     system2 = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKzxQgondgEYcLpcPdJLrTdNgZ2gznOHCAxMdaceTUT1";
     systems = [ system1 system2 ];
   in
   {
     "secret1.age".publicKeys = [ user1 system1 ];
     "secret2.age".publicKeys = users ++ systems;
   }
   ```
4. Edit secret files (these instructions assume your SSH private key is in ~/.ssh/):
   ```ShellSession
   $ agenix -e secret1.age
   ```
5. Add secret to a NixOS module config:
   ```nix
   {
     age.secrets.secret1.file = ../secrets/secret1.age;
   }
   ```
6. Use the secret in your config:
   ```nix
   {
     users.users.user1 = {
       isNormalUser = true;
       passwordFile = config.age.secrets.secret1.path;
     };
   }
   ```
7. NixOS rebuild or use your deployment tool like usual.

   The secret will be decrypted to the value of `config.age.secrets.secret1.path` (`/run/agenix/secret1` by default).

## Reference

### `age` module reference

#### `age.secrets`

`age.secrets` attrset of secrets. You always need to use this
configuration option. Defaults to `{}`.

#### `age.secrets.<name>.file`

`age.secrets.<name>.file` is the path to the encrypted `.age` for this
secret. This is the only required secret option.

Example:

```nix
{
  age.secrets.monitrc.file = ../secrets/monitrc.age;
}
```

#### `age.secrets.<name>.path`

`age.secrets.<name>.path` is the path where the secret is decrypted
to. Defaults to `/run/agenix/<name>` (`config.age.secretsDir/<name>`).

Example defining a different path:

```nix
{
  age.secrets.monitrc = {
    file = ../secrets/monitrc.age;
    path = "/etc/monitrc";
  };
}
```

For many services, you do not need to set this. Instead, refer to the
decryption path in your configuration with
`config.age.secrets.<name>.path`.

Example referring to path:

```nix
{
  users.users.ryantm = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    passwordFile = config.age.secrets.passwordfile-ryantm.path;
  };
}
```

##### builtins.readFile anti-pattern

```nix
{
  # Do not do this!
  config.password = builtins.readFile config.age.secrets.secret1.path;
}
```

This can cause the cleartext to be placed into the world-readable Nix
store. Instead, have your services read the cleartext path at runtime.

#### `age.secrets.<name>.mode`

`age.secrets.<name>.mode` is permissions mode of the decrypted secret
in a format understood by chmod. Usually, you only need to use this in
combination with `age.secrets.<name>.owner` and
`age.secrets.<name>.group`

Example:

```nix
{
  age.secrets.nginx-htpasswd = {
    file = ../secrets/nginx.htpasswd.age;
    mode = "770";
    owner = "nginx";
    group = "nginx";
  };
}
```

#### `age.secrets.<name>.owner`

`age.secrets.<name>.owner` is the username of the decrypted file's
owner. Usually, you only need to use this in combination with
`age.secrets.<name>.mode` and `age.secrets.<name>.group`

Example:

```nix
{
  age.secrets.nginx-htpasswd = {
    file = ../secrets/nginx.htpasswd.age;
    mode = "770";
    owner = "nginx";
    group = "nginx";
  };
}
```

#### `age.secrets.<name>.group`

`age.secrets.<name>.group` is the name of the decrypted file's
group. Usually, you only need to use this in combination with
`age.secrets.<name>.owner` and `age.secrets.<name>.mode`

Example:

```nix
{
  age.secrets.nginx-htpasswd = {
    file = ../secrets/nginx.htpasswd.age;
    mode = "770";
    owner = "nginx";
    group = "nginx";
  };
}
```

#### `age.secrets.<name>.symlink`

`age.secrets.<name>.symlink` is a boolean. If true (the default),
secrets are symlinked to `age.secrets.<name>.path`. If false, secerts
are copied to `age.secrets.<name>.path`. Usually, you want to keep
this as true, because it secure cleanup of secrets no longer
used. (The symlink will still be there, but it will be broken.) If
false, you are responsible for cleaning up your own secrets after you
stop using them.

Some programs do not like following symlinks (for example Java
programs like Elasticsearch).

Example:

```nix
{
  age.secrets."elasticsearch.conf" = {
    file = ../secrets/elasticsearch.conf.age;
    symlink = false;
  };
}
```

#### `age.secrets.<name>.name`

`age.secrets.<name>.name` is the string of the name of the file after
it is decrypted. Defaults to the `<name>` in the attrpath, but can be
set separately if you want the file name to be different from the
attribute name part.

Example of a secret with a name different from its attrpath:

```nix
{
  age.secrets.monit = {
    name = "monitrc";
    file = ../secrets/monitrc.age;
  };
}
```

#### `age.ageBin`

`age.ageBin` the string of the path to the `age` binary. Usually, you
don't need to change this. Defaults to `rage/bin/rage`.

Overriding `age.ageBin` example:

```nix
{pkgs, ...}:{
    age.ageBin = "${pkgs.age}/bin/age";
}
```

#### `age.identityPaths`

`age.identityPaths` is a list of paths to recipient keys to try to use
to decrypt the secrets. All of the file paths must be present, but
only one needs to be able to decrypt the secret. Usually, you don't
need to change this. By default, this is the `rsa` and `ed25519` keys
in `config.services.openssh.hostKeys`.

Overriding `age.identityPaths` example:

```nix
{
    age.identityPaths = [ "/var/lib/persistent/ssh_host_ed25519_key" ];
}
```

#### `age.secretsDir`

`age.secretsDir` is the directory where secrets are symlinked to by
default.Usually, you don't need to change this. Defaults to
`/run/agenix`.

Overriding `age.secretsDir` example:

```nix
{
    age.secretsDir = "/run/keys";
}
```

#### `age.secretsMountPoint`

`age.secretsMountPoint` is the directory where the secret generations
are created before they are symlinked. Usually, you don't need to
change this. Defaults to `/run/agenix.d`.


Overriding `age.secretsMountPoint` example:

```nix
{
    age.secretsMountPoint = "/run/secret-generations";
}
```

### agenix CLI reference

```
agenix -e FILE [-i PRIVATE_KEY]
agenix -r [-i PRIVATE_KEY]

options:
-h, --help                show help
-e, --edit FILE           edits FILE using $EDITOR
-r, --rekey               re-encrypts all secrets with specified recipients
-i, --identity            identity to use when decrypting
-v, --verbose             verbose output

FILE an age-encrypted file

PRIVATE_KEY a path to a private SSH key used to decrypt file

EDITOR environment variable of editor to use when editing FILE

RULES environment variable with path to Nix file specifying recipient public keys.
Defaults to './secrets.nix'
```

#### Rekeying

If you change the public keys in `secrets.nix`, you should rekey your
secrets:

```ShellSession
$ agenix --rekey
```

To rekey a secret, you have to be able to decrypt it. Because of
randomness in `age`'s encryption algorithms, the files always change
when rekeyed, even if the identities do not. (This eventually could be
improved upon by reading the identities from the age file.)

#### Overriding age binary

The agenix CLI uses `rage` by default as its age implemenation, you
can use the reference implementation `age` with Flakes like this:

```nix
{pkgs,agenix,...}:{
  environment.systemPackages = [
    (agenix.defaultPackage.x86_64-linux.override { ageBin = "${pkgs.age}/bin/age"; })
  ];
}
```

## Community and Support

Support and development discussion is available here on GitHub and
also through [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#agenix:nixos.org).

## Plugin Support

Agenix supports age plugins. If you want to use a specific plugin, add it to `age.plugins`.
For example to enable YubiKey support, you have to enable the corresponding plugin:

```nix
{
  age.plugins = [pkgs.age-plugin-yubikey];
}
```

Note that this doesn't add the plugins to the agenix CLI. Here you will
still only have access to the plugins that are installed on your system.

## YubiKey Support

YubiKeys are supported by using the age plugin `age-plugin-yubikey`.
Be sure to setup your YubiKey as outlined in the official [instructions](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey#configuration),
and add the plugin to your configuration:

```nix
{
  age.plugins = [pkgs.age-plugin-yubikey];
}
```

## Threat model/Warnings

This project has not been audited by a security professional.

People unfamiliar with `age` might be surprised that secrets are not
authenticated. This means that every attacker that has write access to
the secret files can modify secrets because public keys are exposed.
This seems like not a problem on the first glance because changing the
configuration itself could expose secrets easily. However, reviewing
configuration changes is easier than reviewing random secrets (for
example, 4096-bit rsa keys). This would be solved by having a message
authentication code (MAC) like other implementations like GPG or
[sops](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) have, however this was left
out for simplicity in `age`.
